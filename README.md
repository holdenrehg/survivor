Game prototype using custom cpp.

## Assumptions

I'm creating this as an example and for learning. I'm not a c++ veteran. I'm putting as little time as possible to get the build system/build processes set up so that I can focus on making the game. The main goal is to create a functional small game or prototype with c++ using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

This project is being built on an Ubuntu 21.04 instance running on a Dell XPS 15 laptop.

## Building (w/ cmake)

```console
$> bin/build
```

## Running

```console
$> build/game
```
